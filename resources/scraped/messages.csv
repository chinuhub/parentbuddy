Thanks so much Bindesh for ur valuable input...,10
Dear Bindesh / Madhavi...Found you two the most knowledgeable of all regarding NiBS...Any idea bout the languages taught at NiBS apart from English and Hindi?,11
"Thanks Bindesh...I'm the mom of another aspirant for NiBS... Apart from the fees which you pointed as on the higher side, are there any other recurrent charges which hike it up further?",12
@Charu...My son is in Nibs....we have just paid swimming charges last year ...apart from that have not spend a single penny on anything...not even on craft...every material school has provided.,13
Great...Thanks Madhvik...Haven't made it there yet...Just hopeful. Are you happy overall with the school..,14
"@Charu I have no issues so far...As mentioned in the feedback given by Bindesh Pandey, the school gives individual attention to kids.... the way they teach is very different...its not about completing syllabus specially for junior classes...it's more about learning and enjoying...No writing in class Nursery

Regarding cons which Bindesh has mentioned , my views on them are
--&gt; fee: last year we have paid around 1.6 lacs as opposed to 2 lacs
--&gt;Transport : I have not faced any issue. One can find transport issues everywhere be it school, public  or office transport. So you can find the same in other schools too be it late due to traffic or rain etc.

--&gt; Nibs have managed space well for each sport...but they don't have really big cricket ground. It is due to the 2 acre space on which it is built. If big cricket ground is someone's criteria then there are other schools built on larger area in dwarka.
",15
@ madh,16
Thanks madhavik...yesterday also u spared time to clear my doubts...actually i was not able to retrieve that conversation so hv to post it again...,17
Today i went to nibs to hv a clear picture of the school in n out...found it different from other school so far visited...its seems to be based more on practical knowledge which is essential at d beginners level...,18
"@Neha it's true...Nibs don't have any exams till class 6.....Its all about journal writing , project work, plays , practical approach...
Since their way is different I request all parents to think properly before admitting their kids in Nibs... As I have seen parents complaining afterwards about the No writing and No Exams in Nursery to teachers. I will not comment on other schools as every school has their own approach and philosophy but for me Nibs is good for my Kid. 

",19
neha did you confirm admission? how much did they ask you to pay?,20
Thanks so much @Madhavik,21
@charu they hv called parents on 11th n 14th of mar for verification n deposition of fees..we hv to deposit fifty thousand at d time of admission...i will b going on 11th...what abt u?,22
@Neha ...11th and 14 th is for candidates who got selected in draw or this is the parents they have shortlisted for management quota?. Thanks,23
"They follow the Montessori style of education. Fees will be around 2 lacs per annum. They don't focus on writing skills for the nursery kids.
",24
"Yes @ag...their teaching pattern is different...but want to know onething since they hv no writing in nursery,will they lack behind in writing part wen compared with kids of other schools where they follow normal method ....",25
@Neha.. I found the same.,26
"from experience I can share - the kids don't lag behind anything. Just because - other schools start teaching how to write to a 3 year olds; it doesnt makes it the norm. In fact at 3 or 4 years - the grip is still developing. My son who is in KG in NiBS - knows how to read, write, count. And what gives me most satisfaction is - that he understands the concept behind what is taught in school to him.",27
"@Neha Nibs stresses on listening and thinking in Nursery... listening and recognising phonic sounds is more important for them than writing...and they do many fun activities with kids and teach parents how to make the finger muscles strong so that when they start writing it does not hurt them.....and this thing has continued for full year.....Kids can recognize sounds well and they can read any 3 letter word without actually mugging them....even if the word is new they know how to read it properly.
Writing part can be taken up after 4 years and trust me we all started our education when we were 4+ and we know how to write. 




",28
That what i wanted to confirm...no one can better explain than a parent of a child studying in nibs...thanks so much @Bindesh,29
Vry true @madhavik...u people hv really cleared my doubts ...now i will not hv any problem in deciding....thanks so much for ur help...,30
"Onething more how much they focus on language development,communication skill n fluency development...",31
"@Neha ...They give equal opportunity to every kid to speak ....
Give plenty of project work [as per the age] which kids have to do on their own and present in front of class or higher classes.
Initial classes[Nursery &amp; KG] they just want kids to think , imagine and express be it any indian language as language should not act as a barrier to express what one is thinking and small kids have to say a lot....But on the same hand they develop English communication and fluency in kids. ",32
Hmmm...thanks@madhavik,33
"Sorry madhavi,i hv been wrongly spelling ur name...plz excuse...",34
"Hi, my son is in nursery in Nirmal Bhartia school and I couldn't be happier. I would list few points that I like about the school which might help u to make the decision

1. Individual attention - teachers are really connected with the child.they know about his eating habits, behavior, academics of course.first Ptm was all about how the kid is at home.. We had a tragedy at home and teachers supported us fully..

2. No pressure at all on the kids.. Learning is so much fun that they don't even realize they are doing something.. Always excited to make projects. Most of the nursery students can read all three letter words.. It's so much fun to see them trying to make/read new words. So they are not lagged behind at all.. Just not taught to write which they will anyways do from kg and beyond..

3.Parent teacher communication is very encouraged.. Just a note in the diary and you can meet the teacher.. There are a few walk in days too.. Concerns are taken very seriously..

4.They have a swimming pool, football ground, basketball court.. The art activities senior kids do are way beyond ordinary..

5.You will find the Principal a lot on the school rounds.. And she is very inspiring

6.Kids are very comfortable with the teachers.. My kid really cries to talk to his teacher if he thinks I am on phone with her..

7.Every kid is given a chance to perform/speak.. The school is very patient with the kids.. On sports day, they did not hurry any kid and did not even remove the props till the last kid finished.. This just shows their concern.

8. Kids are not ranked rather encouraged to perform..

9.Transportation is not at par but am sure Nibs is not the only school facing this problem..

As of now I feel Nibs is the best decision I took for my boy..",35
Thanks so much @nishant...hope to join nibs parent community soon...,36
"I understand from the thread that Nibs is really good for foundation years, what about the feedback of school as middle and high school? Is it as good as it should be in senior classes?",37
No idea deepti about their senior levels but one thing for sure i will b putting him in nibs now after so much of digging in to it...hv received positive reviews from everyone so far...,38
@neha..Good morning ! yeah even i am inclined towards it after the reviews.   though i didn't get shortlisted in draw i have written email to them to consider. But i still wanted clarity on senior level as well because i want one school to be continued til 12th.. thats what i plan but never know how things works in future. So decision should be based on considering entire 12 years. ,39
@Deepti ...One cannot predict how our kids or school would do in 10 years time...The Schools which are on top today can go down and vice versa.... Nibs had good result last year...Will search If i get the figures as they have shared the result analysis and summary  with each parent.,40
"Thanks Madhavi :)
",41
That's true... As per my knowledge senior parents are also happy.. They have put few parent's numbers on the board you can call them up...,42
Thanks Nishant ..so is your son in KG or prep now ? Also were you shortlisted in draw last year or management quota ? My ward is not shortlisted in in first list ..so i am still waiting ,43
"My son is in nursery...i was in the wait list.. But I also mailed them for quota seat.. I got a call from them after about a week by then wait list was also clear.. So



All the best for your ward..",44
"Nishant, Did you pay some donation under management seat? i need some clarity if NIBS take donation or not?",45
No donation...,46
@madhavi...plz confirm if nibs is 5 days a weeks...,47
Yeah 5 days week for nursery and kg... And they call senior kids a few times on Saturday too,48
@Neha as Nishant mentioned for Nursery and KG its 5 days ....for junior school only 1 saturday working and for middle and senior  2 saturday working.,49
Thanks so much@nishant...,50
Anyone got call for management quota seat in NIB.,51
@ashish no....my son got selected in d draw...,52
Thanks,53
"I got the call Ashish.
How much they demanded?",54
did you got a cal for mnagement quota seat ? how &gt;,55

"@Thank you so much Rakesh for your kind words..I have just shared my experience about the school with parents......I was in similar situation last year and I can understand how you must be feeling right now.

All the very best to you and your kid.


",58
Thanks Madhavi.,59
I got a call from Nibs for management quota seat. I will be meeting them tomorrow for this.,60
I also got a call for management quota seat.  Will be meeting them tomorrow,61
@deepti do let us know the outcome of your meeting with nibs...,62
"Sure will share ..@ Neha
I am confused myself at the moment a lot..on one hand is the learning methodology in Nibs which is attracting me but obviously this comes with a high fees. On the other hand i am feeling what if my ward lags in academics because at the end all children become part of the rat race at some stage ..if not in early years..they will definitely feel the pressure of exams, studies Boards in later years so ..should this academics start early like in normal schools like BGS, Sachdeva etc or should we choose Nibs, VIS where focus is on academics plus co-circular. ",63
"@ Deepti
I am also thinking likewise.  
Their methods may be innovative but the high fee is pinching.  2 lacs is too high.  ",64
"@Gagan, did you meet them today i.e. Nibs..what did they share, only fees or something else as well",65
"Dear All
In vasant Valley exams starts from 9th onwards but still they have very good  results of 12th class",66
"@Deepti.  My wife went there yesterday.  They said since the School is on, they cannot arrange for the visit.  Asked to come again.  Fee is 2 lacs p.a. (1.8 lacs fixed and including others comes to approx 2 lacs.  Meals ofcourse from home only).
Their campus is small and also not a big play ground.  Though I am reading in difference comments that their teaching methodology is different.  How different and how beneficial, not sure.",67
"Yes but we know vasant valley results

..We don't know anything about nirmal bhartia class 12th results...They are not featured on their website like other schools...Why is that... Anybody pls?",68
"@Charu It's a new school...I guess it's their 2nd or 3rd  batch appearing for class 12th this year
Their 10th CGPA score was ""9"" last year...Not very sure about 12th class numbers but overall school average was around 83-85% 

",69
@Charu and Madhavi..when i visited the school and specifically asked the results of 10th and 12th the person responsible said she doesnt remember which is little odd because generally the admission incharge would know this information. Anyways still i went ahead and did the admission because of the overall reviews.,70
"@Deepti I cannot comment why she said she doesn't remember....may be she is confused about the exact figures and don't want to give wrong info or might be some other reason..

Nibs is a new school....hardly 1 or 2 batches have appeared for board exams. ....Your concern is justified .....

I was also concerned last year but then I thought comparing them with already established schools is also not fair and I cannot predict future....as of now I have no concerns and issues with the school.",71
"Thanks Madhavi..one of the reasons i went ahead with admission was same, that so far no negative review or comment or feedback about the school except the high fees. Even for VIS we hear comments like it is money minded school, marketing etc..but none for NiBS... also i saw NibS was rated above VIS at educationworld.in 2016 ranking..so yeah i am convinced that i have selected the best for my kid. They had just 2 batches of 12th so far so by the time our wards grow up i look forward to more convincing results.. :)",72
@Deepti Very true....My cousin's kids are studying in Venkateswar Global rohini and they have always given this feedback that it's a money minded school....Their daughter is very good in studies and since she was in very small school they applied for class 2 in Venkateshwar global ....she got 98/100 in all tests given during her admission ...still school took huge donation.... I know many people who have given 2 lac above donation for VIS dwarka and Venkateshwar global.,73
"Hi Deepti and Madhavi, my concerns are the same....the school doesn't give out much information about their academic performance...their teachers or the senior sections or even their achievements in sports or debates or quizzing etc...holistic development includes these as well...wonder why this is not discussed as this is important too...",74
"@Charu, Someone has posted an excel sheet showing cbse results of many schools in India for the last 3 years.This may answer your query to some extent.Here is the link to the page containg excel as attachment

<a href=""http://www.admissionsnursery.com/forum/topics/nursery-admissions-in-delhi-schools-2017-18-official-thread-for-a?commentId=2660304%3AComment%3A1412978&amp;xg_source=activity"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://www.admissionsnursery.com/forum/topics/nursery-admissions-in...</a>",75
The Numbers are not correct for Nibs...their average was between 83-85%.,76
I got my son admitted to Nirmal Bhartia ... didnt charge anything for the management seat... it is pinching my pocket but we hope the money is worth it ..just keeping the fingers crossed !!!,77
Lets hope for the best @guneet...i hv too admitted my child in nibs...lets wish our lil ones Goodluck for future....hope they enjoy their new journey of formal schooling....,78
"Hey Neha and Guneet



Got my kid into NiBS too....Guess we will all meet up soon...It will be good to connect with you all...And yes fingers crossed that it's the right decision...Best, Charu :)",79
Wow charu...its such a wonderful feeling to b connected with u guys thru this forum...yes really look forward to meeting u people too...wen they hv called u all for orientation prog?me by d end of march...,80
"Yes they said the same...Didn't specify the date though, said they'll call and inform. Just glad we have like minded parents there...Am sure kids will be happy at least for the next few years and hope the school catches up in the senior sections too by the time our kids grow up...",81
I will also go on Tuesday for payment. wasn't able to decide on Saturday but I guess I will take a chance Too after hearing so many reviews. The fees is but of course very high and the school is still not air conditioned nor is the bus AC but that's a good thing,82
"Hi deepti,though the fees is not pocket friendly but i guess its worth after reading so many positive reviews from all concerned...lets all take a chance n rest everything God will take care of...",83
"Great Deepti...So it's Neha, Guneet, you and me on board at least...That's a good start I feel...We already have a few friends ... :)",84
"Hello All, count me as well :) got my kid into NIBS on saturday finally. I am sure it will be a good decision.",85
"Hi, i too got admission for my kid in NBS on saturday, reading feedback from all parents ,i think i took the right discision",86
I am in as well and sure that it will be for the greater good of our children. :-),87

I have got 85% good feedback about St.Mary's from parents whose kids are studying there.

"@ranjeet please note the school in which your ward studied is St. Mary's and not St Marry. Parents praise their ward's school as long as they study there but start bad-mouthing as soon as they get admission in other school. Now your ward is studying in Bal bharti so you have rated it on the top of the list of all the schools of Dwarka even ahead of DPS Dwarka. Parents on this forum consistently wrote about the high student-teacher ratio in Bal Bharti, even at Montessori level ie.45 children in nursery in one section and lacks individual attention,so how it is different from St Mary's can you elaborate with some facts....



The branch of St Mary's school in safdarjung enclave is quite reputed in south Delhi.This has been featured in this year's HT top 10 survey of south west delhi of 2011.Their Dwarka branch also is quite old and good but may not be at par with their south delhi's branch but still good.

RD Rajpal may not be carrying so much of reputation but it's not unhygenic at all so please don't malign the school.

"Hi Ranjeet... I visited R D Rajpal in November during Vibgyor fest. Their Nursery block looked very colourful and impressive (maybe new paint)and neat &amp; clean too. As junior classes are on Ground floor, it is safe for the kids. Also, I was told that they are making Nursery wing air-conditioned from upcoming session (thus no hot/cold weather). I have no clue about how it was in 2009, but now things are different.",154

Academics focus good and co- curricular activites little lesser than Bal Bharti. The School building is biggest and considered best among it's four branches in Delhi.

I don't know why very unapproachable and most expensive schools  are always on such lists. My  idea  of a good school is simply a good, learning program, where my child can find his space and may grow up as a good human. More than that, I am looking for a small and safe school preferably close to my home with 1-2-3 sections with limited children and focus on real good work with each child. This is how all the good schools are internationally. I will not recommend any particular school right here but I am observing a few lesser known ones in depth. Please guys, let the life and of our kids remain simple and full of good values. Lets our social  show off stigma not become the prime criteria behind selecting the school for our children. What will I tell others. and for that my friends lets not make admission such a burdensome and unfair exercise for everyone that the schools which are asking for lakhs of rupees even before the admission, we are finding them good for our children. What values will they teach ?",254

"If good school means what school teaches and how school teaches &amp; with a reasonable fee structure, then I would say

5. QUEEN VALLEY (AC)
6. N K BAGRODIA

Maxfort, NBPS, OPG and SVIS are also progressive school but their charges are very unreasonably high for no reason. According to my knowledge this is the analysis.

Please send me a mail at saurabhjai@gmail.com,268

@madhavi - this year they hav asked for Rs. 9000 for Stationery and uniform ...quite high as compared to wat u said !!!,276
"@Guneet If you are referring to the circular which says that carry 9000 /- we too have got the same..... Its the approx and max amount .....last year I paid Rs. 2900 /- for books/stationery and Rs. 1400 /- for the uniform (2 shorts 2 t shirts and 3 pair of socks).... shoes we have bought from outside

Last year we were asked to carry 8000/- but total came 4400/- :)

",277
I am still carrying stationary and uniform receipts ...If you wish can mail you for reference :)  ,278
"@Madhavi,
This year the stationary cost for Nursery was 3150 and i spend 2850 on uniform 3 sets of shirt, shorts &amp; socks and 1 pair of shoes. So its 6K for now. We also need to buy pants in July for Dengue season, kids are supposed to wear pants instead of shorts. Winter uniform has to be purchased again. So i guess the entire year total will be around 9-10K ",279
"very true deepti...moreover, i feel that NIBS is pretending to be really costlier than last year. Though Its a good school i have surveyed but infra wise some issues are there like very small ground and unfavorable location..hope the fee hike is justified for us later...
",280
thanks for the clarification madhavi ... my husband is a salaried employee and I hav just started an online venture from home ...so getting hyper abt the entire cost thing,281
Its ok I can understand...If you need any help from my end please feel free to contact.,282
There has been a change of date for Orientation ...any specific reasons???,283
"@Guneet No idea why it has been postponed :(....


Nibs has different orientation sessions for New parents and Class Orientation 
Last year they had orientation 4 to 5 days after the school reopens and teachers by that time had time to meet the kids and they had answered all our queries related to our kids and class. 

Actually I was surprised when i saw that they are doing orientation earlier this time but I think it's a good decision that they have postponed it.


",284
"Will call the school tomorrow to know why the date has been shifted.

Does anyone know when nibs would take summer Holidays.is it for 45 days or 60 days",285
@ HK Summer Holidays is for 45 days but in maximum cases they prepone the date because of severe weather conditions.,286
"Hello frnz.. just wanted to have suggestion if we all parents on the orientation day can advice school to have 1 fruit break (may be at 9) in addition to the break at 10:30 as these tiny tots are not able to eat properly in the early morning time . Moreover, this way they can get the habit of eating this healthy which is also easily digestible snack daily by their own. wat are your views abt this??  (coz if we all can say then may be the school can think of implementing the same.) as most of the schools do have the same.",287
Hello how was your daughter's first day ... Ur suggestion is indeed a welcome one ... kids will get into the habit of eating fruits,288
"Hello everyone,
My son is in Ankur Malhaar and he enjoyed a lot on his first day in school. Is anyone taking bus route no. 3 in the morning?",289
"It was good..Initially she was ok but when she boarded the bus in the morning, 2 small kids were crying as if they are going to a jail .. :P  so, she also also started sobbing (crying is communicable ) but later on we followed the bus till school as it was her first day and found her normal..wat abt your son? 
dear pl remember to emphasize on 10 mins fruit break coz mass emphasis can seriously help thats my thinking .Also its good for these kids coz as i know my kid who actually don't willingly eat fruits except apple.",290

"My son usually eat a fruit in the evening and never crib about it and also I keep one small serving of fruit in his lunch box so I don't mind a fruit break either. We also followed  the bus yesterday as it was his first day and found him normal. He seems to be happy n excited, hope this will continue :)",292
I also agree on 9am break.,293

"My son is in route 3 in the morning and i think they keep changing the route at the time of drop, yesterday it was 9 and today it was 3 only but the driver was same for both days.",303
