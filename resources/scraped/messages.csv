@Guneet If you are referring to the circular which says that carry 9000 /- we too have got the same..... Its the approx and max amount .....last year I paid Rs. 2900 /- for books/stationery and Rs. 1400 /- for the uniform (2 shorts 2 t shirts and 3 pair of socks).... shoes we have bought from outsideLast year we were asked to carry 8000/- but total came 4400/- :)",18
"
I am still carrying stationary and uniform receipts ...If you wish can mail you for reference :)  ",19
"
@Madhavi,
This year the stationary cost for Nursery was 3150 and i spend 2850 on uniform 3 sets of shirt, shorts & socks and 1 pair of shoes. So its 6K for now. We also need to buy pants in July for Dengue season, kids are supposed to wear pants instead of shorts. Winter uniform has to be purchased again. So i guess the entire year total will be around 9-10K ",20

very true deepti...moreover, i feel that NIBS is pretending to be really costlier than last year. Though Its a good school i have surveyed but infra wise some issues are there like very small ground and unfavorable location..hope the fee hike is justified for us later...

@Guneet No idea why it has been postponed :(....
Nibs has different orientation sessions for New parents and Class Orientation 
Last year they had orientation 4 to 5 days after the school reopens and teachers by that time had time to meet the kids and they had answered all our queries related to our kids and class. Actually I was surprised when i saw that they are doing orientation earlier this time but I think it's a good decision that they have postponed it.",26
,27
"
@ HK Summer Holidays is for 45 days but in maximum cases they prepone the date because of severe weather conditions.",28
"
Hello frnz.. just wanted to have suggestion if we all parents on the orientation day can advice school to have 1 fruit break (may be at 9) in addition to the break at 10:30 as these tiny tots are not able to eat properly in the early morning time . Moreover, this way they can get the habit of eating this healthy which is also easily digestible snack daily by their own. wat are your views abt this??  (coz if we all can say then may be the school can think of implementing the same.) as most of the schools do have the same.",29

Hello everyone,
My son is in Ankur Malhaar and he enjoyed a lot on his first day in school. Is anyone taking bus route no. 3 in the morning?",31
"
It was good..Initially she was ok but when she boarded the bus in the morning, 2 small kids were crying as if they are going to a jail .. :P  so, she also also started sobbing (crying is communicable ) but later on we followed the bus till school as it was her first day and found her normal..wat abt your son? 
dear pl remember to emphasize on 10 mins fruit break coz mass emphasis can seriously help thats my thinking .Also its good for these kids coz as i know my kid who actually don't willingly eat fruits except apple.",32

@Rumana The pick up is for every class as morning timings are same for whole school and drop is only for Ankur and Pallav that's why the route numbers are different.
