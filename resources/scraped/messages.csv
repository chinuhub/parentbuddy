Dear Neha.. I had shared detailed feedback on Nirmal Bhartia some months back. You can check it on following link:

@Charu...My son is in Nibs....we have just paid swimming charges last year ...apart from that have not spend a single penny on anything...not even on craft...every material school has provided.",13
,14
"
@Charu I have no issues so far...As mentioned in the feedback given by Bindesh Pandey, the school gives individual attention to kids.... the way they teach is very different...its not about completing syllabus specially for junior classes...it's more about learning and enjoying...No writing in class NurseryRegarding cons which Bindesh has mentioned , my views on them are
--> fee: last year we have paid around 1.6 lacs as opposed to 2 lacs
-->Transport : I have not faced any issue. One can find transport issues everywhere be it school, public  or office transport. So you can find the same in other schools too be it late due to traffic or rain etc.--> Nibs have managed space well for each sport...but they don't have really big cricket ground. It is due to the 2 acre space on which it is built. If big cricket ground is someone's criteria then there are other schools built on larger area in dwarka.

@ madh",16

"
@Neha it's true...Nibs don't have any exams till class 6.....Its all about journal writing , project work, plays , practical approach...
Since their way is different I request all parents to think properly before admitting their kids in Nibs... As I have seen parents complaining afterwards about the No writing and No Exams in Nursery to teachers. I will not comment on other schools as every school has their own approach and philosophy but for me Nibs is good for my Kid. ",19
"
neha did you confirm admission? how much did they ask you to pay?",20
,21
,22
,23
,24
"
They follow the Montessori style of education. Fees will be around 2 lacs per annum. They don't focus on writing skills for the nursery kids.
",25
,26
"
@Neha.. I found the same.",27
"
from experience I can share - the kids don't lag behind anything. Just because - other schools start teaching how to write to a 3 year olds; it doesnt makes it the norm. In fact at 3 or 4 years - the grip is still developing. My son who is in KG in NiBS - knows how to read, write, count. And what gives me most satisfaction is - that he understands the concept behind what is taught in school to him.",28
"
@Neha Nibs stresses on listening and thinking in Nursery... listening and recognising phonic sounds is more important for them than writing...and they do many fun activities with kids and teach parents how to make the finger muscles strong so that when they start writing it does not hurt them.....and this thing has continued for full year.....Kids can recognize sounds well and they can read any 3 letter word without actually mugging them....even if the word is new they know how to read it properly.
Writing part can be taken up after 4 years and trust me we all started our education when we were 4+ and we know how to write. 

",29
,30
,31
,32
"
@Neha ...They give equal opportunity to every kid to speak ....
Give plenty of project work [as per the age] which kids have to do on their own and present in front of class or higher classes.
Initial classes[Nursery & KG] they just want kids to think , imagine and express be it any indian language as language should not act as a barrier to express what one is thinking and small kids have to say a lot....But on the same hand they develop English communication and fluency in kids. ",33

"
I understand from the thread that Nibs is really good for foundation years, what about the feedback of school as middle and high school? Is it as good as it should be in senior classes?",39
,40
"
@neha..Good morning ! yeah even i am inclined towards it after the reviews.   though i didn't get shortlisted in draw i have written email to them to consider. But i still wanted clarity on senior level as well because i want one school to be continued til 12th.. thats what i plan but never know how things works in future. So decision should be based on considering entire 12 years. ",41
"
@Deepti ...One cannot predict how our kids or school would do in 10 years time...The Schools which are on top today can go down and vice versa.... Nibs had good result last year...Will search If i get the figures as they have shared the result analysis and summary  with each parent.",42

I got a call from Nibs for management quota seat. I will be meeting them tomorrow for this.",64
"
I also got a call for management quota seat.  Will be meeting them tomorrow",65
,66
"
Sure will share ..@ Neha
I am confused myself at the moment a lot..on one hand is the learning methodology in Nibs which is attracting me but obviously this comes with a high fees. On the other hand i am feeling what if my ward lags in academics because at the end all children become part of the rat race at some stage ..if not in early years..they will definitely feel the pressure of exams, studies Boards in later years so ..should this academics start early like in normal schools like BGS, Sachdeva etc or should we choose Nibs, VIS where focus is on academics plus co-circular. ",67
"
@ Deepti
I am also thinking likewise.  
Their methods may be innovative but the high fee is pinching.  2 lacs is too high.  ",68
"
@Gagan, did you meet them today i.e. Nibs..what did they share, only fees or something else as well",69

Dear All
In vasant Valley exams starts from 9th onwards but still they have very good  results of 12th class",70
"
@Deepti.  My wife went there yesterday.  They said since the School is on, they cannot arrange for the visit.  Asked to come again.  Fee is 2 lacs p.a. (1.8 lacs fixed and including others comes to approx 2 lacs.  Meals ofcourse from home only).
Their campus is small and also not a big play ground.  Though I am reading in difference comments that their teaching methodology is different.  How different and how beneficial, not sure.",71
,72
,73
"
@Charu It's a new school...I guess it's their 2nd or 3rd  batch appearing for class 12th this year
Their 10th CGPA score was ""9"" last year...Not very sure about 12th class numbers but overall school average was around 83-85% ",74
"
@Charu and Madhavi..when i visited the school and specifically asked the results of 10th and 12th the person responsible said she doesnt remember which is little odd because generally the admission incharge would know this information. Anyways still i went ahead and did the admission because of the overall reviews.",75
"
@Deepti I cannot comment why she said she doesn't remember....may be she is confused about the exact figures and don't want to give wrong info or might be some other reason..Nibs is a new school....hardly 1 or 2 batches have appeared for board exams. ....Your concern is justified .....I was also concerned last year but then I thought comparing them with already established schools is also not fair and I cannot predict future....as of now I have no concerns and issues with the school.",76
"
Thanks Madhavi..one of the reasons i went ahead with admission was same, that so far no negative review or comment or feedback about the school except the high fees. Even for VIS we hear comments like it is money minded school, marketing etc..but none for NiBS... also i saw NibS was rated above VIS at educationworld.in 2016 ranking..so yeah i am convinced that i have selected the best for my kid. They had just 2 batches of 12th so far so by the time our wards grow up i look forward to more convincing results.. :)",77
"
@Deepti Very true....My cousin's kids are studying in Venkateswar Global rohini and they have always given this feedback that it's a money minded school....Their daughter is very good in studies and since she was in very small school they applied for class 2 in Venkateshwar global ....she got 98/100 in all tests given during her admission ...still school took huge donation.... I know many people who have given 2 lac above donation for VIS dwarka and Venkateshwar global.",78

The Numbers are not correct for Nibs...their average was between 83-85%.",81

http://www.dwarkadelhi.com/DwarkaDelhiEducation/Top20Schools.php     
all the school mentioned in above list are good schools ",227

How is St Thomas Dwarks, I dont see any feedback about this school. I have been informed that this is a very good school but approach is very bad.

It's a good school and you can go ahead.",229
"
Hello Lathaaji,
 
Do you have any idea about Bal Bhavan Dwarka",230
"
Academics focus good and co- curricular activites little lesser than Bal Bharti. The School building is biggest and considered best among it's four branches in Delhi. The only drawback is no transport and food facility in school. At present teachers keep changing. Their main focus in sports is Cricket in which they excel. Nowadays strict discipline is followed.",231
"
Lathaji, please give ur feedback about St Thomas, BGS, NBS, Modern convent, Basava and NK Bagrodia Dwarka. In which order these schools should be preferred?",232
"
BGS>Basava>=St.Thomas, NK Bagrodia>Modern Convent. I am not sure I think NBS will go after NK Bagrodia.",233
"
Lathaji, am I correct if I say that all the schools mentioned above are far better than ITL and RD Rajpal in all respects?",234
"
You can put ITL in between St.Thomas and NK Bagrodia and RD Rajpal after NK Bagrodia.",235
"
Dear Lathaaji, My daughter get selected in ITL as well as in Modern Convent School. Plz suggest which one to select. I don't know much about both the schools. Distance wise both are same from my residence. In both the schools I get selected through draw and I say they follow the fair process as I witnessed the same in Modern Convent today. Plz suggest on basis of child care and overall development in academics as well as in extra curricular activities. Both have big grounds and sport and club facilities. But how much is real and functional I don't know. Your suggestion will be appreciated.",236
"
Is the first list of Modern convent out?
",237
,238
"
The formal list will be displayed tomorrow at 4pm. Today was the draw for the 49 seat left. Remaining 88 seats already filled having more than 50 points. All the parents with 50 points had been called to witness the same.",239
"
we also have 50 pts but we were nt called",240
"
Plz check the list at the school as there was 228 candidates with 50 points. All 228 names announced and listed. First draw of lots done for 49 seats. And then draw of lots for waiting list. In case you have 50 points your child name must be there in today's list. You can enquire at the school.",241
"
@ Sunita

This school is transparent in admission process and just check out with the school. ",242

ITL would be best option.",243

No doubt NK Bagrodia.",268

Latha Ji I have a query. Going through the admission process it's not confirm to get child admitted in choice of schools. So in-case admission is taken in any school(not preferred) and after that If I receive call from other better schools then shall I be getting the school fee refunded from the previous school if I withdraw admission. If yes will they provide full refund? Are there any guidelines related to it which we can refer? ",269

Any reviews about Delhi International School. Not able to find much on net.",272

@CMNAYAK, With no offense to any 'SO CALLED BEST SCHOOL' seeing this list, I feel that it is a list of schools with many many sections and thousands of kids. I don't know why very unapproachable and most expensive schools  are always on such lists. My  idea  of a good school is simply a good, learning program, where my child can find his space and may grow up as a good human. More than that, I am looking for a small and safe school preferably close to my home with 1-2-3 sections with limited children and focus on real good work with each child. This is how all the good schools are internationally. I will not recommend any particular school right here but I am observing a few lesser known ones in depth. Please guys, let the life and of our kids remain simple and full of good values. Lets our social  show off stigma not become the prime criteria behind selecting the school for our children. What will I tell others. and for that my friends lets not make admission such a burdensome and unfair exercise for everyone that the schools which are asking for lakhs of rupees even before the admission, we are finding them good for our children. What values will they teach ?",273

If good school means what school teaches and how school teaches & with a reasonable fee structure, then I would say
1. MOUNT CARMEL (non AC)
2. DPS (non AC)
3. BAL BHARTI (non AC)
4. J M INTERNATIONAL (AC)
5. QUEEN VALLEY (AC)
6. N K BAGRODIA
7. BGS
8. BASAVA
Maxfort, NBPS, OPG and SVIS are also progressive school but their charges are very unreasonably high for no reason. According to my knowledge this is the analysis.

@Guneet If you are referring to the circular which says that carry 9000 /- we too have got the same..... Its the approx and max amount .....last year I paid Rs. 2900 /- for books/stationery and Rs. 1400 /- for the uniform (2 shorts 2 t shirts and 3 pair of socks).... shoes we have bought from outsideLast year we were asked to carry 8000/- but total came 4400/- :)",297
"
I am still carrying stationary and uniform receipts ...If you wish can mail you for reference :)  ",298
"
@Madhavi,
This year the stationary cost for Nursery was 3150 and i spend 2850 on uniform 3 sets of shirt, shorts & socks and 1 pair of shoes. So its 6K for now. We also need to buy pants in July for Dengue season, kids are supposed to wear pants instead of shorts. Winter uniform has to be purchased again. So i guess the entire year total will be around 9-10K ",299

very true deepti...moreover, i feel that NIBS is pretending to be really costlier than last year. Though Its a good school i have surveyed but infra wise some issues are there like very small ground and unfavorable location..hope the fee hike is justified for us later...

@Guneet No idea why it has been postponed :(....
Nibs has different orientation sessions for New parents and Class Orientation 
Last year they had orientation 4 to 5 days after the school reopens and teachers by that time had time to meet the kids and they had answered all our queries related to our kids and class. Actually I was surprised when i saw that they are doing orientation earlier this time but I think it's a good decision that they have postponed it.",305

@ HK Summer Holidays is for 45 days but in maximum cases they prepone the date because of severe weather conditions.",307

Hello frnz.. just wanted to have suggestion if we all parents on the orientation day can advice school to have 1 fruit break (may be at 9) in addition to the break at 10:30 as these tiny tots are not able to eat properly in the early morning time . Moreover, this way they can get the habit of eating this healthy which is also easily digestible snack daily by their own. wat are your views abt this??  (coz if we all can say then may be the school can think of implementing the same.) as most of the schools do have the same.",308

Hello everyone,
My son is in Ankur Malhaar and he enjoyed a lot on his first day in school. Is anyone taking bus route no. 3 in the morning?",310

It was good..Initially she was ok but when she boarded the bus in the morning, 2 small kids were crying as if they are going to a jail .. :P  so, she also also started sobbing (crying is communicable ) but later on we followed the bus till school as it was her first day and found her normal..wat abt your son? 
dear pl remember to emphasize on 10 mins fruit break coz mass emphasis can seriously help thats my thinking .Also its good for these kids coz as i know my kid who actually don't willingly eat fruits except apple.",311

@Rumana The pick up is for every class as morning timings are same for whole school and drop is only for Ankur and Pallav that's why the route numbers are different.
